<h2 align="center"> 🔥 Netflix clone v1.2🔥</h2>


### Purpose 💡
   
Netflix is ​​very grateful to copy. It is toned down in terms of colors, simple visuals and at the same time very complicated due to the logic responsible for video playback and recommendations.

Ver 1.0 was very simple and neat. I want the next one to be more advanced. 
 
As I gain new knowledge in programming, I would like it to be as close to the original as possible.

  
### Development Plan 📅
